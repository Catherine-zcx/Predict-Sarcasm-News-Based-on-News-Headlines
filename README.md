# Predict-Sarcasm-News-Based-on-News-Headlines
# The group project of COMM7370 
This project mainly through the identification of news headlines to determine the content of the article is ironic. We did some cleaning on existing data and chose three models for testing: a one-dimensional CNN (single-window), one dimensional CNN (multi-window), and RNN-LSTM. 

The codes in this project are from many sources.
The following parts are did by me: 2.view the dataset; 3.Text processing; 4.10-fold cross-validation. The model of CNN(single-window, multi-window), RNN is constructed by my partner.
